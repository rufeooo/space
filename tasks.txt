This document is meant to give you and I some context into what the other is working
on and what we believe need to be done in the future. This is not meant to be an
exhaustive list but instead provide you and I the means to work independently on items
without duplicating work.

The format for each line item is [user]: <Description>

If a line item has a <Description> and no [user] that means one of us believes this task
should be done but are not actively working on it.

Delete items when they are done.

---------- TASKS ---------- 

new scenario -
  anthony: sync mouse cursor position to ui
  anthony: buttons for module placement
  alan: level 2: unlock pod module
  module construction progression
  level 2: unlock ship for 2nd player
  implementation for player ownership of a ship
  level 3: enemy invasion hits one ship
  level 3: invasion continues until death
  deepen combat

gameplay -
  prototype building ship extensions while in space
  Motion on ships
  Unit inventory for grabbing minerals

ai -
  c file with branching?
  global "blackboard" for group decisions (do we have a game example of groupthink for ai?)

sound -

  : Develop a system for playing audio / sound files. I think we should do our best to
    minimize external dependencies for the sake of build time / complexity but would
    not be surprised if we had to adopt one for this task.

ui -

  anthony: Header on ui panes.
  anthony: Close ui pane.
  anthony: Minimize ui pane.
  anthony: Move ui pane.
  anthony: Sliders.
  anthony: Button relative to pane.
  anthony: imui::SameLine() or something - renders next imui call on same line.
  anthony: Text input.
  anthony: Button click effect.
  anthony: Function to test whether cursor is intersecting with any UI element. Can
           be used to determine if interaction is in game vs ui.

platform -

  anthony: Bring macosx window to focus when starting. Currently game starts in background.
  anthony: fix win32 window movement hang

graphics - 

  anthony: Implement camera zoom. This will require implementing an inverse function.
  anthony: Antialias inner rings on circles.
  anthony: Dynamic lighting.
  anthony: Load bitmaps.
  anthony: Moving background, so it actually looks like we're flying.

engine -
  pause frames

network -
  handle truncated udp packets and zero length packets
  retransmission clock OR consider modifying ack_frame and ack_sequence to use latest value w/ packet history
  server turn injection/reordering
  server retransmission of NotifyGame
  client tune netqueue for smooth simulation under network variance
