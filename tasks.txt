This document is meant to give you and I some context into what the other is working
on and what we believe need to be done in the future. This is not meant to be an
exhaustive list but instead provide you and I the means to work independently on items
without duplicating work.

The format for each line item is [user]: <Description>

If a line item has a <Description> and no [user] that means one of us believes this task
should be done but are not actively working on it.

Delete items when they are done.

  : Develop a system for playing audio / sound files. I think we should do our best to
    minimize external dependencies for the sake of build time / complexity but would
    not be surprised if we had to adopt one for this task.
